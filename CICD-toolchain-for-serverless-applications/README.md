## CI/CD toolchain for Serverless Applications

A continuous delivery pipeline to deploy serverless applications created in the AWS Lambda console. With continuous delivery, every change that you push to your source control repository triggers a pipeline that builds and deploys your application automatically. The Lambda console provides examples for common application types with sample code and templates that create supporting resources. 

To get started, go to the [AWS Lambda console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-east-1#/create/application). For more information, see [the documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/applications-tutorial.html).
